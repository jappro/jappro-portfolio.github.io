      <h2 id="about-heading">About Me</h2>
      <p>I am <strong>Uche Japheth</strong>, an on‑chain researcher focused on transforming data across <strong>AI, DeFi, and GameFi</strong> into clear, actionable insights. My work centers on understanding how decentralized systems function at a fundamental level how value flows, how incentives shape behavior, and how narratives align (or fail) with real utility.</p>

  <p>As a <strong>Growth Strategist</strong>, I scale marketing concepts through hands‑on community building, moderation, and ecosystem engagement. I prioritize sustainable growth driven by clarity, trust, and long‑term participation over surface‑level promotion.</p>

  <p>Beyond Web3, I am a <strong>Petroleum Engineering student</strong> and a <strong>Procurement Practitioner at Racine Technologies Limited</strong>. This background strengthens my understanding of structured operations, compliance, accountability, and real‑world business processes which I apply to partnerships, campaign execution, and community operations.</p>

   <p><em>By combining decentralized community building with professional operational discipline, I help projects grow authentically, sustainably, and with long‑term vision.</em></p>
